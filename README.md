# Searchbar with Vue JS

Here is a component I've done for an online shop CMS.  
It's a search bar that fetches items.

## Description

This example is a search bar that displays a list of customers. You can view a customer summary with name and
email.<br>
You also can select one of them with the _**'choose button'**_  (**_'Details'_** button doesn't work yet, you can easily
add a details link).

There is a list of fake customers available in [`data.json`](mock/data.json), mocked by a fake [`server`](mock/server.js) sending data. The
component uses the data to display dynamically the list of customers.
